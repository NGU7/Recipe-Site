            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Pesto, fresh parsley and oregano lend plenty of flavor (and color) 
            to Reeâ€™s breakfast casserole. To cut down on prep time, freeze the 
            dish and thaw in the refrigerator the night before you plan to serve 
            it. The next morning, all you need to do is bake and eat!
            </p>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <Ol>
                <li>
                    Generously butter a 9-by-13-inch baking dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Tear the onion rolls into chunks and place 
                    them in the bottom of the baking dish. Sprinkle 
                    the roasted peppers on top, then tear the cream 
                    cheese over the peppers. Sprinkle with the mozzarella, 
                    then cut the butter into pats and scatter over the top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix together the milk, pesto, parsley, oregano, salt, 
                    pepper and eggs in a large bowl and pour slowly over 
                    the top of the dish, making sure to get it all around 
                    and into the crevices. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap, 
                    then foil. Freeze for up to 2 months.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To cook from frozen: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the foil and plastic wrap, then re-cover the 
                    casserole with the foil. Bake for 45 minutes, then 
                    remove the foil and continue baking until firm and set, 
                    about 10 minutes more. Portion and serve immediately.

                    casserole with the foil. Bake for 45 minutes, then raise 
                    the temperature to 350 degrees F, remove the foil and continue

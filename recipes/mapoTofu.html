            <img src="./foodImages/mapoTofu.jpeg">
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>This spicy, aromatic Sichuan dish is recognizable from the citrus 
                aroma of Sichuan peppercorns and the spicy fermented flavor of 
                hot bean sauce. According to legend, Mapo Tofu (Pock-Marked Grandma's 
                Tofu) was named after an old Chinese woman who served the dish to
                 her restaurant guests. She became known for it and people began 
                 referring to the dish as the pock-marked woman's tofu.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons whole Sichuan peppercorns</li>
                <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons hot bean paste (such as toban djan)</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons hot sesame oil or hot chile oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dark brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>One 1-inch piece of ginger, finely chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon salted fermented black beans, rinsed and finely chopped</li>
                <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
                <li>One 14-ounce package firm tofu, drained, patted dry, and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
                <li>1/3 cup thinly sliced scallions, white and light green parts only</li>
                <li>5 cups steamed jasmine rice, for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a wok over medium-high heat and toast the Sichuan peppercorns 
                    until fragrant, about 10 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer the 
                    peppercorns to a bowl to cool. Coarsely grind the peppercorns in a spice 
                    grinder or with a mortar and pestle and set aside. In a medium bowl, stir 
                    together the chicken broth, hot bean paste, cornstarch, hot sesame oil, 
                    soy sauce and sugar; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat the wok over medium-high heat. Add the canola oil, garlic, ginger 
                    and fermented black beans and cook until fragrant, stirring often, about 
                    10 seconds. Add the ground pork and cook, stirring occasionally and breaking 
                    up the meat with a wooden spatula or spoon, until it is browned, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                    (Lower the heat to medium if the garlic starts to burn.) Add the reserved ground 
                    peppercorns, the tofu and the soy sauce mixture. Cook, stirring once to combine, 
                    until the sauce is reduced, thickened and glossy, about 2 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove from heat and garnish with the scallions. Serve with steamed jasmine rice.

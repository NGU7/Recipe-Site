            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This recipe makes just two servings of cold brew, so if you're new to the method, 
                it will be a good test batch to see exactly how strong you want your steep to be. 
                Once you've found your sweet spot of brewing time, you can double, triple or even 
                quadruple the yield. The strained concentrate will keep tightly sealed in the 
                fridge for up to a week.
            </p>

            <h3>Ingredients & Directions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/3 cup of whole coffee beans</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cup of water</li>
                <li>Milk or sweetener of your choice </li>
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Grind the beans in a coffee grinder on the coarse setting; the ground coffee 
                    should resemble coarse sugar or sand.</li>
                <li>Cut a 6-by-6-inch double thickness of cheesecloth. Put the coffee in the 
                    middle and tie tightly with kitchen twine. Put the sachet in a pint Mason 
                    jar or other 2-cup glass container. Add the cold water and seal tightly. 
                    (If you prefer, you can just add the coffee directly to the cold water and 
                    strain through cheesecloth after steeping.)</li>    
                <li>Refrigerate and steep for at least 12 hours, though 18 to 24 hours is best.
                     Remove the sachet, press to extract as much liquid as possible back into 
                     the jar and discard the sachet. </li>
                <li>To serve, pour equal parts cold brew concentrate and cold water over ice. 
                    Add milk and sweetener if using.</li>      
            </ol>

            <h1>Breakfast Recipes</h1>
            <p>Breakfast recipes consist of things that would be created and eaten in the morning. Although breakfast could be at anytime since it's definition is to break a fast that comes from not eating after a long time (Usually after sleeping).

            <h1>Lunch Recipes</h1>
            <p>Lunches are meals typically eaten around mid-day. Personally I feel that anything after 4:30 
                is dinner, although some people can hold out for longer than others.
